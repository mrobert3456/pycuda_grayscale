# Grayscale image using pycuda

![input_img](./data/input.jpg)

![input_img](./data/output.jpg)

# âš™ How it works

The algorithm represent a data parallel implementation of image grayscaling.
Each thread will be responsible to convert one pixel of the image to gray.

cd pycuda_grayscale
```

## âš¡ Software Dependencies

This project utilizes the following packages:

- Python 3
- OpenCV 2
- Numpy
- [Pycuda](https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/)

# ðŸš€ Usage

To convert an image to grayscale, simply run:

```
python grayscale.py input_img.jpg
```

The output file will be saved as `output.jpg`
